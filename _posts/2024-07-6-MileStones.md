## What are Milestones
Milestones allow us to track progress on groups of issues or pull requests within a repository. They serve as a way to organize and manage work in a structured manner, providing a clear timeline and set of goals for your project. By grouping related tasks together, milestones help in planning and forecasting project timelines, ensuring that key objectives are met on schedule.

How Milestones help in planning and tracking progress.
Setting Goals: At the beginning of a project or a new phase, you can set milestones to outline major objectives and deadlines.

Monitoring Progress: Throughout the project, you can monitor the progress of each milestone by checking which issues and pull requests have been completed and which are still open.

Adjusting Plans: If you find that a milestone is at risk of being delayed, you can reallocate resources or adjust the scope to ensure that the project stays on track.

Creating A milestone
To create a milestone, navigate to your repository (or create one if you don't have one yet). For guidance on creating a repository, you can read this article. After setting up your repository, go to the "Issues" or "Pull requests" tab. Next to the search field, click on "Milestones".



After clicking on the "Milestones" button, a new page will appear. On this page, click on "Create a Milestone" or "New Milestone" to begin creating your milestone.



Populate the milestone with details such as the title (e.g., the release of software or a specific task), the due date (which can also be the release date of the application), and a description of the milestone. Once you've filled in these details, click the "Create milestone" button.



When the milestone is created, this is how it looks. To edit the milestone, simply click on "Edit." To close it, click on "Close," and to delete it, click on "Delete."



Using a milestone with an Issue
Milestones are used with issues to help track the progress of a project. Start by creating an issue in your repository. If you are not familiar with creating issues, click here to learn more about issues.

There are different ways to use milestones with issues. The first method is to associate a milestone when creating an issue, as shown below. Tap on "Milestones" on the right-hand side, below "Projects." A list of milestones will appear; select the milestone you want to associate with the issue. After that, click "Submit new issue."



Now let's use a milestone with an already created issue. Navigate to "Issues," and select the issue you want to associate with the milestone by checking the checkbox next to it. Just above the issues list, click on the "Milestone" dropdown menu and select the milestone you want to use. And that's it!



Using a milestone with a Pull request
Create another branch, make some commits, and then create a pull request. You can associate it with the appropriate milestone by checking the checkbox next to the pull request and selecting the milestone from the "Milestone" dropdown menu.



As demonstrated below, the progress of a milestone can be tracked through the issues and pull requests associated with it. When a pull request is merged or an issue is closed, it contributes to the progress of the milestone.
